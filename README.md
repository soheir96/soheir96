# 👋 Hi there, I'm Seán Ó Héir

I'm a PhD student at the **University of Edinburgh**, based in the **School of Informatics** and a member of the [Data Science Unit](https://informatics.ed.ac.uk/data-science-unit/about-us/people). My research focuses on using **geographic information systems (GIS)** and **earth observation (EO)** data with **deep learning models** to estimate and monitor socioeconomic indicators such as **population** and **poverty**.

---

## 🧠 Research & Work

Currently, I’m developing an **automated geospatial data pipeline** for:
- Downloading large-scale EO and GIS datasets
- Preprocessing and aligning multi-source data
- Extracting meaningful features to support **environmental** and **demographic analysis**

My broader research goals include building robust, scalable tools that help us better understand human and environmental dynamics — especially in underrepresented or data-scarce regions.

## 🛠️ Tools & Tech

- 🐍 **Python** (core language for all my research)
- 🌍 **Geospatial Libraries**: `geopandas`, `rasterio`, `xarray`, `shapely`, `pyproj`
- 🧠 **Deep Learning**: `PyTorch`, `Lightning`, `scikit-learn`
- 🛰️ **EO & Remote Sensing**: `sentinelhub`, `earthengine-api`, `GDAL`

## 🤝 Open to Collaboration

I'm always interested in collaborating on **Earth Observation for Good** projects — especially ones that involve open data, sustainable development, or humanitarian applications. If you have a project or an idea, feel free to reach out!
